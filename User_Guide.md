## Introduction and Overview

The Childhood Cancer Clinical Data Commons (C3DC) enables searching demographic and phenotypic clinical data of childhood cancers. These data have been harmonized to a standard set of common data elements (CDEs). C3DC empowers researchers to search for participant-level data to create synthetic cohorts and export data for analysis.

This document describes a high-level overview of the features of C3DC. Investigators are encouraged to explore C3DC for themselves, using this guide as a primer.
